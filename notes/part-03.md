# Live Chat in Youtube. 

2 ways you can handle this?.
challenges : To get data live.
how do u update data on your page ?  

DATA (Live) -> 1: Websockets (two way connections handshake btw server and ui.) u can quickly send data from either side. no regular interval.(zerotha (stock market)) whatsapp.

2: API polling. UI (request)----> server but data goes from server from ui. . regular interval suppose it check the server after 10s interval. u poll data after the regular interval of 10s. (gmail) cricbuzz. yt is using api polling . it fetches the data after 1.5s 

order does not matter in the live chat. 
after certain messages yt starts deleting the messages.
